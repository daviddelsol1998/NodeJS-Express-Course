Node js is a javascript runtime. This means it can allow javascript to run outside of a browser (the server).
V8 is the engine in which js runs in the browser (created by google) --> compiles to machine code.

by doing node FILENAME on terminal we run the code in the terminal of our machine.
This is the same as Python3 FILENAME when python is installed.

pending to learn what require means.
(require is the js equivalent of Python3 import PACKAGE, require('PACKAGENAME') passed as string?)

file handling notes on comments of first-app.js

user --> client(browser/device) --> sends a request to server (mywebsite.com) --> response html back to --> client(browser/device).


in server we do (authentication, databases, input validation, business logic) -- not available to the user.


NodeJs is not limited to a "server".

NodeJs in the concept of web development is used to run a server and listen to requests.
the server does the business logic (handle requests, validate input, connect to db)
the server return responses (render html, json,... )

An alternative to NodeJs could be like python with flask which I am already familiar with.

The REPL is READ EVAL PRINT LOOP accessed by typing node in terminal. Good playground.
